- 👋 Hi, I’m @appmandom
- 👀 I’m interested in code and apps. I want to make my own app and help people do things in a better and easier way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make an NFT smart contract.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating NFT's and selling them. I also want to create a B2B solution using smart contracts as a basis to help businesses collaborate based on their knowledge and skills.
